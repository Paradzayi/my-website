        My hard work had paid off, the late nights and the early mornings. Getting my results I smiled as I saw the following:

          When I joined GISkonsult I had very little knowledge of HTML/CSS and absolutely no knowlegde of Nodejs and server side technologies. So I was hesitant at first.

          I was recruited on the basis that I had developed a functional application that was implemented by Anderson Adventist High School. So I finally agreed and I am having a great experience there. Everyday I learn new skills but most importantly I'm learning how to learn.
