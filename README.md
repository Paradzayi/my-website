# My website

To keep transparency I have decided to open source my website. Feel free to clone it modify and use it as you wish to your own gain. If you like it don't forget to star it.

## Contibuting

I really apreciate contributions to the site. Feel free to create pull requests for any features you like me to implement. You can also create issues reporting bugs.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:paradzayi/my-website.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd my-website
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
